# Parallel-N-Body-Problem
Parallel Programming solution to the N body problem using CUDA and MPI.

# Problem Specification

The n-body problem is one of the most famous problems in mathematical physics, with its first complete mathematical formulation dating back to Newtonâ€™s Principia. Classically, it refers to the problem of predicting the motion of n celestial bodies that interact gravitationally. Nowadays, other problems, such as those from molecular dynamics, are also often referred to as nbody problems. 
For n = 2, the problem was completely solved by Johann Bernoulli. 
For n = 3, solutions exist in special cases.
In general, numerical methods must be used to simulate such systems.
The output is typically the positions and velocities of all the particles at some final time or sequence of times.
We assume Newtonian physics to describe the motion.
